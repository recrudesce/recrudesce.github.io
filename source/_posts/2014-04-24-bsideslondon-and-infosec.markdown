With less than a week to go before [BSides London](https://www.securitybsides.org.uk) and [Infosec 2014](http://www.infosec.co.uk), I'm trying to list out all the people/companies I want to talk to, and also determine whether to take my laptop or my tablet - I'm thinking laptop...

Anyway, quick and simple post this one - I'll be at both events.  You can tweet me [@recrudesce](https://twitter.com/recrudesce) if you want to meet up and say "hi".

If you're going too, have a good time - remember to get loads of swag ;)
